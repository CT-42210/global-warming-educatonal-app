ok so here we go:
this app was built by me and @Skillmaster4#6511
it basicly is an area efect chart for climate change, and is designed to help you understand. 
you get a multiple choice question quiz for the first half, 
and the second half is a choose youur own adventure.
----------------------------------
HOW TO RUN THE .EXE (WINDOWS):
its pretty simple. just doublle click it.
if you get a warning message from wondows or an antivirus, just allow it 
i promise its not a virus
-----------------------------------
HOW TO RUN THE FILE FOR MAC:
this is a bit more tricky. 
to run: right click the new file in your downloads called [global_warming_edu_app], and click "show package contents" (yes, the file does not have an extention. ignore this.)
then, open the contents folder.
next, Open the MacOS folder
finally, run the global_warming_edu_app app by double clicking the file in that folder
do not delete anything in this folder, the process is tricky and it needs all the files to run.
