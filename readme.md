ok so here we go:
this app was built by me and @Skillmaster4#6511
it basicly is an area efect chart for climate change, and is designed to help you understand. 
you get a multiple choice question quiz for the first half, 
and the second half is a choose youur own adventure.
----------------------------------
HOW TO RUN THE .EXE (WINDOWS):
its pretty simple. just doublle click it.
if you get a warning message from wondows or an antivirus, just allow it 
i promise its not a virus
-----------------------------------
HOW TO RUN THE FILE FOR MAC:
this is a bit more tricky. 
to run: right click the new file in your downloads called [global_warming_edu_app], and click "show package contents" (yes, the file does not have an extention. ignore this.)
then, open the contents folder.
next, Open the MacOS folder
finally, run the global_warming_edu_app app by double clicking the file in that folder
do not delete anything in this folder, the process is tricky and it needs all the files to run. 
By default MacOS will block the file from running. so here is how youu run it:
after double clikcing the terminal proess, it should give you a warning.  
go to system preferences, and the security tab.
go over to general, 
and on the bottom third of the window, will be a button saying "open anyway"
click that.
after that, another window will open with 2 buttons
click open.
then, a terminal window should open. full screen it, and play!
